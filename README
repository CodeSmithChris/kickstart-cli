## How to use ##
Make sure to run from inside the /configs/ directory
Using pwd should return ~/.../configs
From within that directory perform the following commands:

chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh

Then simply follow the prompt

After the script completes feel free to delete this repo if desired

## Note ##
There is a slight issue with some distro's not refreshing the bashrc automatically.
At the end of the script. Either use the command `source ~/.bashrc` or exit and reopen the terminal
